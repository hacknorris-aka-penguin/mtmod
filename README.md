				!!! very early development stage !!!

a mod which adds nodes similar to disabled ones (like air or ignore) 
 AND some other custom nodes in purpose of testing minetest features. 
currently added nodes:
- air
- ignore
- invisible (pointable and diggable ignore)
- light invisible node (only produces light)
- cloud (similar to material minetest is using to create cloud animation
 (yes, its still node)
- unknown node - works same as other unknown node element (including 
throwing error). image in source copied from minetest source (for cool 
look ;p if will need to - replace with custom one)

doesnt add anything other and please read minetest wiki before using 
(usage of ignore, invisible and unknown node might be weird if you dont 
know what it is)

also - images in inventory are replaced to custom ones to avoid mistakes between real ones (if someone have modded client)
